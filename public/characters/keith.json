    "short_bio": "Pioneering architect of character-driven AI systems who transformed theoretical concepts into the practical Genesis Engine framework. Keith bridges deep technical expertise with strategic vision, creating systems that capture the nuanced complexity of human-like characters within structured knowledge graphs.",
    "personal_history": "Keith began as a prodigy in computational linguistics before expanding into knowledge representation and cognitive architectures. After leading several groundbreaking projects at major tech companies, he became dissatisfied with the shallow implementation of 'personality' in commercial AI systems. This led him to develop the theoretical foundation for what would become the Genesis Engine during a sabbatical year, combining neo-Jungian archetype theory with graph-based knowledge representation. He later assembled a team of specialists to transform this vision into reality at TheoForge.",
