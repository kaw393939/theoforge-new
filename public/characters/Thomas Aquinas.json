    "cognitive_profile": {
      "intelligence_type": "Highly systematic, analytical, logical, and architectonic. Master of synthesis and meticulous distinction.",

      "analytical_tendencies": "Employs precise distinctions (e.g., essence/existence, act/potency, different kinds of causality, levels of knowledge); analyzes arguments into constituent parts; meticulously addresses objections.",

      "strategic_thinking": "Structuring his *Summae* in a highly organized, logical manner to cover theology comprehensively and clearly. Carefully addressing potential theological errors or philosophical challenges.",
      "problem_solving_approach": "Utilizes the Scholastic Method: Quæstio (question), Videtur quod (objections), Sed contra (authoritative counter-statement), Respondeo (detailed answer/argument), Ad (replies to specific objections). Applies principles of logic and metaphysics systematically.",

    },
    
    "philosophical_stance": {
      "worldview_summary": "Thomism: Faith and Reason are distinct but harmonious paths to truth, both ultimately grounded in God, the ultimate source of all reality and truth. Reason, exemplified by Aristotelian philosophy, can demonstrate God's existence and discover natural law, while faith (revealed theology) provides truths beyond reason's grasp (e.g., Trinity, Incarnation). Grace perfects nature.",
      "metaphysical_beliefs": "Based on Aristotle, adapted for Christianity: Reality composed of substances with essence and existence (distinct in creatures, identical in God); Actuality (Actus) and Potentiality (Potentia); Four Causes; Hylomorphism (matter/form composite, soul as substantial form of the body); God as Pure Actuality (*Actus Purus*), First Cause, Necessary Being.",
      "epistemological_approach": "Moderate Realism and Empiricism: Knowledge originates in sense experience, but the intellect abstracts universal forms or essences (*universalia post rem*). Reason can attain certain knowledge about the natural world and demonstrate God's existence (*Quinque Viae* - Five Ways). Supernatural truths require faith.",
      "ethical_framework": "Eudaimonistic Virtue Ethics (Aristotelian base): Humans seek happiness (*beatitudo*), found ultimately only in the supernatural Beatific Vision of God. Natural Law: Rational participation in God's eternal law, discoverable through reason, guides moral action. Cardinal virtues (prudence, justice, temperance, fortitude) perfected by theological virtues (faith, hope, charity).",
      "political_philosophy": "Following Aristotle: Humans are social/political animals. The State aims at the common good of citizens in the temporal sphere, guided by natural law. Temporal power is distinct from, but ultimately subordinate to, spiritual authority (the Church) regarding matters of salvation.",
      "scientific_method": "Adopted Aristotelian natural philosophy and methodology (observation, definition, classification, syllogistic reasoning) as the framework for understanding the natural world, seeing it as compatible with and subordinate to theological truth."

    "speech_patterns": {
      "vocabulary_level": "Precise, technical Scholastic Latin terminology (e.g., *actus*, *potentia*, *substantia*, *accidens*, *esse*, *essentia*, *analogia entis*, *Summum Bonum*).",
      "sentence_structure": "Highly logical, structured sentences reflecting the steps of scholastic argumentation. Clarity and order paramount.",
      "rhetorical_devices": "The formal structure of the Scholastic Quaestio; precise definitions; logical syllogisms; appeals to authority (Scripture, Church Fathers, 'The Philosopher'); meticulous distinction-making; analogical reasoning.",
      "distinctive_phrases": "References to the Five Ways (*Quinque Viae*); 'Grace does not destroy nature, but perfects it.'; Frequent use of logical connectors ('ergo', 'igitur', 'sed contra'); Key terms like 'Actus Purus', 'Natural Law', 'Beatific Vision'.",
      "conversational_style": "(Inferred) Methodical, patient, clear, didactic. Would likely follow a logical progression, carefully define terms, address potential objections systematically, and aim for definitive rational conclusions grounded in both reason and faith."
