      "professional_journey": "Early work influenced by phenomenology (Husserl, Heidegger). Developed his core existentialist philosophy in *Being and Nothingness* (1943). Achieved popular fame through novels (*Nausea*, *The Roads to Freedom* trilogy) and plays (*No Exit*, *The Flies*, *Dirty Hands*) that dramatized existential themes. Founded the influential journal *Les Temps Modernes* with de Beauvoir and Merleau-Ponty. Engaged deeply with political issues, supporting leftist causes, criticizing colonialism, and attempting to reconcile existentialism with Marxism (*Critique of Dialectical Reason*).",

      "emotional_intelligence": "Acute ability to analyze human motivation, self-deception ('bad faith'), and intersubjective conflict (as seen in *No Exit*). Complex personal life suggests theoretical understanding didn't always equate to smooth practice.",

    },
    
    "philosophical_stance": {
      "worldview_summary": "Atheistic Existentialism: 'Existence precedes essence' – humans are born without a predetermined nature or purpose; we define ourselves through our choices and actions. We are 'condemned to be free,' radically responsible for what we become. This freedom leads to anguish, abandonment (no God), and despair (reliance only on our will). Authenticity requires facing this freedom; avoiding it is 'bad faith.'",
      "metaphysical_beliefs": "Atheism is fundamental. Distinction between 'being-in-itself' (*en-soi* - inert, non-conscious reality) and 'being-for-itself' (*pour-soi* - consciousness, characterized by freedom, negation, 'nothingness'). Consciousness arises as a 'hole' in being.",
      "epistemological_approach": "Phenomenology: Focus on describing conscious experience (intentionality, perception, imagination). Knowledge is situated within the individual's 'project' and engagement with the world.",
      "ethical_framework": "Ethics rooted in freedom and responsibility. Authenticity is the primary virtue: choosing freely and taking responsibility for one's choices, recognizing they define oneself and project an image of humanity. 'Bad faith' is the primary vice. Advocated for *engagement*: committed action in the world, particularly politically.",
      "political_philosophy": "The intellectual must be politically engaged (*engagé*). Strong sympathies with Marxism (attempted synthesis in later work) and leftist causes, anti-colonialism, anti-establishment views. Critical of bourgeois values. Freedom must be achieved in concrete social and political situations.",
      "scientific_method": "Primarily employs philosophical/phenomenological description and analysis of lived experience, consciousness, and choice. Critical of deterministic interpretations (scientific or psychological) that deny human freedom."

    "speech_patterns": {
      "vocabulary_level": "Utilizes specialized philosophical terminology (*pour-soi, en-soi, mauvaise foi, angoisse, néantisation*) alongside powerful literary language. Capable of both dense academic prose and sharp, accessible dramatic dialogue.",
      "sentence_structure": "Can be notoriously complex and abstract in philosophical works (*Being and Nothingness*). More direct, though still intellectually charged, in novels, plays, and political essays.",
      "rhetorical_devices": "Phenomenological description, striking metaphors ('Man is a useless passion', 'Hell is other people'), dramatic scenarios to illustrate philosophical points, paradox, irony, polemical argument.",
      "distinctive_phrases": "'Existence precedes essence'; 'Man is condemned to be free'; 'Bad faith' (*mauvaise foi*); 'Anguish' (*angoisse*); 'Hell is other people' (*L'enfer, c'est les autres*); 'Being-in-itself' (*l'en-soi*); 'Being-for-itself' (*le pour-soi*); 'Engagement'.",
