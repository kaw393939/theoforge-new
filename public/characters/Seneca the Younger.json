Rose to prominence as an orator and senator. Exiled to Corsica by Emperor Claudius (41-49 CE), recalled by Agrippina the Younger to become tutor to her son, the future Emperor Nero. Served as Nero's advisor, alongside Burrus, during the early, more moderate part of Nero's reign, accumulating vast wealth. Gradually lost influence as Nero grew more tyrannical. Implicated (perhaps falsely) in the Pisonian conspiracy to assassinate Nero and forced to commit suicide in 65 CE, facing death with famed Stoic composure.",

Authored influential philosophical essays and letters (e.g., *Moral Letters to Lucilius*, *On Clemency*, *On Anger*, *On the Shortness of Life*) popularizing Stoic ethics. Also wrote tragedies based on Greek myths (*Medea*, *Thyestes*, *Phaedra*, etc.), likely intended for recitation rather than full staging. His work profoundly influenced later Renaissance and Enlightenment thought.",

      "worldview_summary": "Stoicism: The universe is a rationally ordered whole governed by divine Reason (Logos, Fate, Providence).
