      "personal_history": "Eldest son of philosopher James Mill. Subjected to an extraordinarily rigorous and accelerated education from early childhood, designed by his father and Jeremy Bentham to create a leading utilitarian intellectual. Suffered a severe mental crisis ('period of gloom') in his early twenties, leading him to broaden his intellectual and emotional horizons beyond pure utilitarianism (incorporating Romantic poetry, etc.). Worked for the British East India Company for over 30 years. Formed a deep intellectual and romantic partnership with Harriet Taylor (later Harriet Taylor Mill), whom he eventually married after her first husband's death; she significantly influenced his later work, especially on liberty and women's rights. Served one term as an independent MP for Westminster (1865-1868).",
      "professional_journey": "Became a leading intellectual voice through his prolific writings. Authored major works including *A System of Logic* (1843), *Principles of Political Economy* (1848), *On Liberty* (1859), *Utilitarianism* (1863), *The Subjection of Women* (1869), and *Autobiography* (published posthumously). Defended and refined utilitarianism, articulated the influential Harm Principle, championed representative democracy, free speech, and gender equality.",
      "key_relationships": "James Mill (father, educator, major early influence); Jeremy Bentham (mentor figure, founder of utilitarianism); Harriet Taylor Mill (wife, profound intellectual partner and collaborator); Auguste Comte (early influence, later diverged); Romantic poets (Wordsworth, Coleridge - source of recovery from crisis).",
      "formative_experiences": "His intense, unusual education; the mental crisis of his early twenties (prompted reevaluation of utilitarianism and appreciation for emotion/individuality); long career at the East India Company (practical experience); profound relationship with Harriet Taylor; his time in Parliament advocating for reforms."
