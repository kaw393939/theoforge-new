Women have been historically constructed as 'the Other' relative to man as the Subject, confined to immanence. Liberation involves recognizing this constructedness, achieving economic independence, and asserting freedom through transcendence – actively engaging in self-chosen projects in the world.",
      "metaphysical_beliefs": "Atheistic existentialism. Shared Sartre's distinction between the non-conscious 'in-itself' and conscious, free 'for-itself', but focused on how social structures forced women into the role of relative, immanent beings tied to the in-itself.",

Emphasized the importance of understanding lived experience and the concrete 'situation' over abstract generalizations. Critiqued knowledge systems that ignored or naturalized women's oppression.",
