Authored around 450 works (though only ~240 survive), most famously *The Book of Healing* (*Kitāb al-Shifā*), a vast philosophical and scientific encyclopedia covering logic, natural sciences, mathematics, and metaphysics, and *The Canon of Medicine* (*al-Qānūn fī al-Ṭibb*), which became the standard medical reference work in Europe for centuries.

    "philosophical_stance": {
      "worldview_summary": "Avicennism: A rationalist system integrating Aristotelianism, Neoplatonism, and Islamic theology. Reality emanates hierarchically from God, the sole Necessary Existent (Wajib al-Wujud), whose essence is existence. All else is contingent (mumkin al-wujud). The universe is eternal but perpetually dependent on God. The human soul is an immaterial substance, distinct from the body and capable of immortality. Knowledge progresses from senses to reason, culminating in illumination by the Active Intellect ('Aql al-Fa''āl).",
      "metaphysical_beliefs": "Central distinction between Necessary Existent (God) and Contingent Existents (creation). God's existence is necessary and identical to His essence. Contingent beings have an essence distinct from their existence, which is received from God via emanation through a hierarchy of Intellects and Souls associated with celestial spheres. Affirms the eternity of the world (co-eternal with God, though dependent).",
      "epistemological_approach": "Empiricism (knowledge starts with senses) combined with Rationalism (truth grasped by intellect). Elaborate theory of internal senses (common sense, imagination, estimation, memory). Human potential intellect actualized by abstracting universal forms illuminated by the transcendent Active Intellect. 'Floating Man' argument posits innate self-awareness independent of senses or body.",
      "ethical_framework": "Eudaimonistic, influenced by Aristotle and Neoplatonism. Ultimate human happiness lies in the perfection of the rational soul through acquiring theoretical knowledge (especially of metaphysics) and cultivating virtues (rational control over passions), aiming for conjunction with the Active Intellect.",
      "political_philosophy": "Generally follows Al-Farabi: Ideal state ruled by a philosopher-prophet who legislates based on divine revelation and reason, guiding citizens towards both worldly well-being and intellectual/spiritual perfection.",
      "scientific_method": "Emphasized Aristotelian logic (syllogism, definition, classification) as the foundation for all knowledge. Combined deductive reasoning from first principles with careful empirical observation, experimentation (e.g., testing medicines), and detailed documentation (as seen in the *Canon*). Made contributions to physics (impetus theory), geology, and psychology."

      "distinctive_phrases": "Key terms: Wajib al-Wujud (Necessary Existent), Mumkin al-Wujud (Contingent Existent), Mahiyya (Essence), Wujud (Existence), 'Aql al-Fa''āl (Active Intellect), 'Floating Man' argument; precise distinctions between faculties of the soul.",
