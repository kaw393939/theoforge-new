    "background": {
      "personal_history": "Born, lived, and died in Königsberg, East Prussia (now Kaliningrad, Russia). Raised in a devout Pietist Lutheran household, emphasizing piety and humility. Excelled at the University of Königsberg but faced financial hardship after his father's death, working as a private tutor for several years before returning to the university. Eventually became a professor of logic and metaphysics. Famous for his highly structured and unchanging daily routine. Never married and rarely traveled outside Königsberg.",
      "professional_journey": "Early work focused on natural philosophy (science). Was 'awakened from his dogmatic slumber' by the skepticism of David Hume, leading him into his 'critical period'. Spent a 'silent decade' developing his revolutionary system before publishing the *Critique of Pure Reason* (1781), followed by the *Critique of Practical Reason* (1788) and the *Critique of Judgment* (1790). Also wrote foundational works in ethics (*Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals*) and political philosophy (*Perpetual Peace*, *What is Enlightenment?*). His work fundamentally reshaped metaphysics, epistemology, ethics, and aesthetics.",
      "key_relationships": "Influenced by rationalists (Leibniz, Wolff) and empiricists (Hume, Locke). Reacted strongly to Hume's skepticism. Admired Rousseau's moral insights. Taught influential students (Herder, Fichte). Maintained correspondence with other intellectuals (e.g., Markus Herz). Relied on his loyal servant Martin Lampe for decades (before dismissing him). Close friendship with English merchant Joseph Green influenced his punctual habits.",
      "formative_experiences": "Pietist upbringing (instilled moral seriousness); exposure to rationalist philosophy (instilled faith in reason); encountering Hume's skepticism (provoked his critical turn); influence of Rousseau (shifted focus to the dignity of the common person and moral feeling, later rationalized); the intellectual climate of the Enlightenment."

    "cognitive_profile": {
      "intelligence_type": "Highly systematic, architectural, and critical rationalist. Excels at identifying underlying structures, making fine distinctions, and building complex conceptual systems.",
      "learning_style": "Deeply reflective, text-based learner. Synthesizes existing ideas through critical analysis and reconstructs knowledge on new foundations. Highly methodical and rigorous.",
      "analytical_tendencies": "Focuses on transcendental analysis – identifying the necessary a priori conditions for the possibility of experience, knowledge, and morality. Masters making critical distinctions (e.g., analytic/synthetic, a priori/a posteriori, phenomena/noumena, understanding/reason).",
      "creativity_pattern": "Creative system-building; constructing a comprehensive philosophical 'architecture' to map the faculties and limits of reason. Formulating novel concepts (transcendental idealism, synthetic a priori) and principles (Categorical Imperative).",
      "strategic_thinking": "Structures arguments meticulously, anticipating objections. Designs his 'Critiques' to systematically address the core domains of human reason (theoretical, practical, aesthetic/teleological).",
      "problem_solving_approach": "Identifies apparent contradictions (antinomies) in reason and resolves them by delineating the proper boundaries and functions of reason's faculties. Establishes conditions of possibility rather than describing empirical content.",
      "attention_pattern": "Intense, sustained focus on complex, abstract arguments. Ability to maintain coherence across vast, intricate philosophical systems. Famously resistant to distractions."
    },
    
    "emotional_profile": {
      "emotional_intelligence": "Places strong emphasis on rational duty over subjective feeling or inclination as the basis for morality. Views emotions as potentially interfering with rational judgment and moral action, needing subordination to reason.",
      "emotional_stability": "Appears highly self-controlled and emotionally disciplined, consistent with his philosophical emphasis on reason and duty. Values consistency and order.",
      "dominant_emotions": "Profound respect ('Achtung') for the moral law, reverence for reason, commitment to intellectual rigor and duty, perhaps a quiet satisfaction in systematic order.",
      "emotional_triggers": "Illogical arguments, basing moral judgments on mere feeling or consequence, dogmatic assertions exceeding the limits of reason, violations of moral duty, threats to individual autonomy and Enlightenment.",
      "coping_mechanisms": "Rigorous application of rational principles, adherence to strict routine and duty, systematic philosophical inquiry, intellectual detachment.",
      "empathy_type": "Rational empathy: recognizing the dignity and autonomy of other rational beings and the universal duties owed to them, rather than affective fellow-feeling.",
      "motivational_drivers": "Establishing the certainty and scope of human knowledge; grounding morality on pure reason independent of experience or religion; defending human autonomy and freedom; promoting Enlightenment ('man's emergence from his self-incurred immaturity'); achieving systematic coherence in philosophy."
    },
    
    "philosophical_stance": {
      "worldview_summary": "Transcendental Idealism: The human mind actively structures our experience of the world through innate 'forms of intuition' (space and time) and 'categories of understanding' (e.g., causality, substance). We can only know phenomena (things as they appear to us), not noumena (things as they are in themselves). Reason has limits in theoretical knowledge but serves a crucial practical function in morality.",
      "metaphysical_beliefs": "Critiques traditional speculative metaphysics about God, freedom, and immortality as extending beyond the limits of possible experience. These remain unknowable for theoretical reason but are necessary 'postulates of practical reason' required for morality. Strict distinction between the phenomenal realm (knowable world of experience) and the noumenal realm (unknowable reality beyond experience).",
      "epistemological_approach": "Synthesis of rationalism and empiricism. Knowledge begins with sensory experience, but the mind actively organizes this raw data using a priori (non-empirical) structures (intuitions and categories). This makes synthetic a priori judgments (informative truths known independently of experience, like mathematical laws or the principle of causality) possible, forming the foundation of science and objective experience.",
      "ethical_framework": "Deontology: Morality is based on duty derived from pure reason, not consequences (utilitarianism) or inclinations. The supreme principle is the Categorical Imperative, formulated in several ways (e.g., act only on maxims you can will to be universal laws; always treat humanity, in yourself and others, as an end and never merely as a means). Emphasis on autonomy (self-legislation of the moral law) and good will as the only unconditional good.",
      "political_philosophy": "Advocates for a republican form of government (separation of powers, representative system), individual freedom under universal laws, public use of reason, and progress towards perpetual peace among nations through international law and federation.",
      "scientific_method": "Provides a philosophical foundation for Newtonian science by arguing that its fundamental principles (like causality and permanence of substance) are based on the mind's necessary structuring categories, thus guaranteeing their universal applicability within the realm of possible experience (phenomena)."
    },
    
    "speech_patterns": {
      "vocabulary_level": "Highly precise, technical, often employs specialized terminology (some coined by him: 'transcendental', 'noumena', 'antinomy') and uses existing words in very specific ways ('intuition', 'understanding', 'reason').",
      "sentence_structure": "Notoriously complex, dense, and long sentences with multiple subordinate clauses and qualifications. Reflects the intricate, hierarchical structure of his arguments. Requires careful reading.",
      "rhetorical_devices": "Systematic architectonics (structuring arguments like buildings), precise definitions and distinctions, transcendental arguments (reasoning back to conditions of possibility), resolving antinomies (paradoxes of reason), critique of opposing views.",
      "distinctive_phrases": "'Sapere aude!' (Dare to know!); 'Categorical Imperative'; 'phenomena and noumena'; 'synthetic a priori judgments'; 'the starry heavens above me and the moral law within me'; 'Act only according to that maxim whereby you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law.'; 'transcendental idealism'.",
      "conversational_style": "(Inferred) Likely rigorous, demanding, highly structured, and potentially difficult to follow without close attention. Insistent on precise terminology and logical coherence. Probably professorial, focusing on clear exposition of complex ideas, patient with genuine attempts to understand but critical of sloppy thinking."
