      "personal_history": "Born into a wealthy Athenian equestrian family. Became a devoted follower of Socrates. Joined the expedition of Cyrus the Younger against his brother King Artaxerxes II of Persia in 401 BCE. After Cyrus's death at Cunaxa, Xenophon played a key role in leading the surviving Greek mercenaries ('The Ten Thousand') on their epic march home (*Anabasis*). Subsequently served under the Spartan king Agesilaus II. Exiled from Athens, likely due to his association with Cyrus (an enemy of Athens' allies) and his pro-Spartan leanings. Granted an estate near Scillus by the Spartans, where he lived, hunted, managed his estate, and wrote for many years. May have eventually had his exile revoked.",
      "professional_journey": "Shifted from student of philosophy to soldier/mercenary commander, then to historian and writer. Authored major historical works (*Anabasis*, *Hellenica* continuing Thucydides' history), Socratic dialogues (*Memorabilia*, *Symposium*, *Apology*, *Oeconomicus*) presenting Socrates as a practical moral teacher, and various treatises on subjects like horsemanship (*On Horsemanship*), hunting (*Cynegeticus*), Spartan society (*Constitution of the Lacedaemonians*), and leadership (*Cyropaedia* - education of Cyrus the Great).",
