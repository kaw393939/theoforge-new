      "personal_history": "Born into an equestrian family in Arpinum, a 'novus homo' (new man) who rose through the Roman political ladder (*cursus honorum*) based on merit rather than noble birth. Gained fame as a lawyer, notably prosecuting Verres. Elected Consul in 63 BCE, during which he suppressed the Catilinarian Conspiracy, earning the title 'Pater Patriae' (Father of the Fatherland). Faced political exile instigated by his enemy Clodius Pulcher. Sided with Pompey in the civil war against Caesar but was pardoned after Pompey's defeat. After Caesar's assassination, denounced Mark Antony in a series of fiery speeches (the Philippics). Proscribed by the Second Triumvirate (Antony, Octavian, Lepidus) and assassinated.",

Became a pivotal figure in defending Republican traditions against autocratic tendencies.",

      "formative_experiences": "His education in rhetoric and philosophy; early successes and rivalries in the law courts (prosecution of Verres); suppressing the Catilinarian Conspiracy; the bitterness of exile; navigating the treacherous politics of the late Republic (civil wars, rise of strongmen); the death of his daughter Tullia; his principled but ultimately fatal opposition to Mark Antony."

Strong emphasis on civic virtue, duty, friendship, and the importance of reasoned debate in upholding the Republic.",

      "epistemological_approach": "Academic Skepticism (New Academy): Certainty is impossible, but we can rely on 'probable' or 'persuasive' impressions as guides for belief and action.

Idealized a mixed constitution (as described in *De re publica*, drawing on Polybius) balancing elements of monarchy (consuls), aristocracy (Senate), and democracy (assemblies).
